      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#BD040E] max-w-fit">Ernest Banda - Candidate for Dallas City Council District #9</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-bold text-[#063159]">
        Dear Community Members,
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        As your candidate for Dallas City Council District #9, I am deeply committed to enhancing our community’s safety, fiscal responsibility, and overall prosperity. Here are the principles and plans guiding my campaign:
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 bg-[#BD040E] text-white p-1 rounded-sm max-w-fit">Public Safety Commitment</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        With over 40 years in Loss Prevention and Asset Protection, and close collaboration with various police agencies, I am dedicated to ensuring our law enforcement is supported and effective. I strongly oppose defunding the police, prioritizing officer safety and community security.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 bg-[#BD040E] text-white p-1 rounded-sm max-w-fit">Fiscal Responsibility</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        I oppose wasteful spending, like the $6.1 million spent on counting trees in city parks. My career has honed my ability to manage budgets effectively, always staying well under budget. I will bring this fiscal discipline to the city council to ensure taxpayer money is spent wisely.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 bg-[#BD040E] text-white p-1 rounded-sm max-w-fit">Engagement and Transparency</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        I believe in the importance of transparency and open communication in government. My commitment is to hold regular town hall meetings, create accessible public forums, and ensure that all decision-making processes are transparent. Your voice is essential in shaping our community’s future.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 bg-[#BD040E] text-white p-1 rounded-sm max-w-fit">Crime and Public Safety Funding</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Given the 37% rise in citywide crime, I support Proposition U, which strengthens our police and firefighters' pensions and funds other vital public safety initiatives. I advocate reallocating frivolous expenditures to enhance our police force and safety measures.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 bg-[#BD040E] text-white p-1 rounded-sm max-w-fit">The Road Ahead</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-[#063159]">
        My campaign is about more than winning an election; it's about fostering significant and lasting change. I bring a wealth of experience, a deep understanding of our community's needs, and a vision for a brighter future. Together, we can address the challenges facing District 9 and ensure it continues to thrive.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Join me on this journey to make District 9 a better place for all. Let's work together to bring about real change and ensure a prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future for every resident.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Warm regards,
      </p>
